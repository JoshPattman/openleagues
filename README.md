# `openleagues` - A simple 1v1 ranking system
OpenLeagues is a very simple toy project for ranking 1v1 leagues. You can rank anything really, but I built it as a toy project to rank a group of people's pool games.

I built OpenLeagues as an educational project to learn about using Go templates with HTMX, and deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Test it out!
